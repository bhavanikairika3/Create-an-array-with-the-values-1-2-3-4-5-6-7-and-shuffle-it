Question : Create an array with the values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and shuffle it. 

Firstly, Lets Understand the Question in detail :  Imagine you have a set of cards with numbers written on them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Creating an array is like arranging these cards in a specific order in front of you. So, you create an array and put these numbers in it, making it look like this: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Now, shuffling the array is like mixing up these cards randomly. You don't know which number will come where after the shuffle. In programming, shuffling means rearranging the order of the numbers. So, after shuffling, the array might look like this: [5, 3, 1, 7, 2, 4, 6].

Let's Understand the Coding Part now : 

import java.util.Arrays; = This line imports the Arrays class from the java.util package. The Arrays class provides various utility methods (functions) for working with arrays in Java. For example, it includes methods for sorting, searching, and filling arrays.

import java.util.Collections; = This line imports the Collections class from the java.util package. The Collections class provides static methods that operate on collections (like lists and sets). It includes methods for sorting, shuffling, and other operations on lists, among other things.

import java.util.List; = This line imports the List interface from the java.util package. A List in Java is an ordered collection of elements. You can think of it like a dynamic array where you can add, remove, and access elements by their index. By importing List, you can create and manipulate lists in your Java program.

public class ShuffleArray {  =  This line creates a new instruction manual (a class) named ShuffleArray. Everything we want to do will be written inside this manual.

public static void main(String[] args) {  =  This line marks the beginning of the main instructions. When you run your Java program, it starts executing from here.

Integer[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};  =  This line creates an array of whole numbers with the values 1 to 7. 

List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(arr);  =  Here, we convert the array into a list. 

Collections.shuffle(list);  =  This line shuffles (mixes up) the list randomly. It's like taking the line of numbers and rearranging.so that they're in a different order. The Collections.shuffle() method does this job for us.

System.out.println("Shuffled Array: " + list);  =  This line prints the shuffled list to the screen. It's like displaying a message on your computer screen. Here, it says "Shuffled Array:" and then shows the shuffled list of numbers.
